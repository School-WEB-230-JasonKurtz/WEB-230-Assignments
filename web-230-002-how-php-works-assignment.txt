1. Identify and explain the differences between server side and client side.

	In web development and web based applications Client-side applications are those that run on the end user's machine and recieve/send information out over a network to a server. On the flip side, Server-side applications/scripts run on a server and recieve/send information out over a network to Client-side application(s). 



2. Identify and explain the differences between scripting and programming languages.

	Scripts are pieces of code that allow task to be automated. They are not compiled into machine code like programs are. Rather, a script is passed through an interpretor in order to run it's code. Traditionally languages such as Javascript, PHP, and Perl have been considered scripting languages. Languages such as C, C++, Java. However, the lines are becoming more and more blurred as scripting languages are sometimes compiled into machine code and programming languages are being used for scripting. One such case is Chrome's V8 Javascript engine that compiles Javascript into machine code. Furthermore, some languages are used for interpreting and compiling such as Python and Ruby.
